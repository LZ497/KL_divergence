Provisional Schedule

- Week 1/2 - Work on the initial KLs. 
- Week 3 - Tensorflow_probability Variational Bayes Tutorials; add one of our KLs 
- Week 4/5 - Sim study with synthetic data (matrix of variational-prior performance for various settings). 
- Week 6 - Comparison on real data (UCI) (Quantitative Evaluation) 
- Week 7 - Comparison on real data (Migration) (Qualitative Evaluation) 
- Week 8 - Additional Writing 
- Week 9 - Bring in interesting KL divergences. 
- Week 10 - Finalize KL and prepare presentation

- Week of 21 - TGiving Nov 28 - Last full week of semester. Dec 7 - Research showcase.

KL divergence next steps: 
Create tables with entries: 
- "column table" with self-entropies. 
- "matrix" with cross-entropies. If closed form, show the solution. If not closed form, show the quantity which cannot be integrated.

We want to verify every divergence with Monte Carlo.

TODO: Make Github repo and email it to Nathan.
